There are several works on providing programing language facilities for fairness~\cite{albarghouthi2017fairsquare,albarghouthi2019fairness}.

Albarghouthi \etal proposed a verification tool, FairSquare, for automatically detect weather a decision making program given a fairness property is fair or not? They have encoded a fairness property as a probabilistic program properties~\cite{albarghouthi2017fairsquare}.
More specifically, fairness properties are formalized as
probabilistic specifications of decision-making programs. FairSquare has a probabilistic precondition defining a probability distribution over input to the decision-making program.  Then it has a quantitative postcondition that can encode various fairness properties.

There are several works in software engineering community~\cite{aggarwal2019black} that address discrimination as a test-intensive in a black-box settings.
