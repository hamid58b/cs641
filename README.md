To Run the project for development.

Open your favorate IDE for python and install python3 with the dependencies listed for fairsquare.

Run python3 decorator_testing.py to test out the motivating example.

You may want a virtual environment so I would recommend creating one outside of this project and directing the project their.

A project was created under pycharm so you can direct pycharm to the Project/FairSquare directory and it will open up the project. You will have to supply your own interpreter and create your own running configuration.
